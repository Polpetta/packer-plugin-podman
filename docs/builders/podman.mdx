# podman

Type: `podman`

The `podman` builder allows you to build container images without using 
[Docker](https://www.docker.io), but instead using [Podman](https://podman.io/),
a rootless and daemonless substitute provided by Red Hat.

## Basic Example: Export

Below is a fully functioning example. It doesn't do anything useful, since no
provisioners are defined, but it will effectively repackage an image.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "type": "podman",
  "image": "ubuntu",
  "export_path": "image.tar"
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
source "podman" "example" {
    image = "podman"
    export_path = "image.tar"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.podman.example"]
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Basic Example: Commit

Below is another example, the same as above but instead of exporting the
running container, this one commits the container to an image. The image can
then be more easily tagged, pushed, etc.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "type": "podman",
  "image": "ubuntu",
  "commit": true
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
source "podman" "example" {
    image = "ubuntu"
    commit = true
}

build {
  sources = ["source.podman.example"]
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Basic Example: Changes to Metadata

Below is an example using the changes argument of the builder. This feature
allows the source images metadata to be changed when committed back into the
Docker environment. It is derived from the `podman commit --change` command
line [option to
Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/).

Example uses of all of the options, assuming one is building an NGINX image
from ubuntu as an simple example:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "type": "podman",
  "image": "ubuntu",
  "commit": true,
  "changes": [
    "USER www-data",
    "WORKDIR /var/www",
    "ENV HOSTNAME www.example.com",
    "VOLUME /test1 /test2",
    "EXPOSE 80 443",
    "LABEL version=1.0",
    "ONBUILD RUN date",
    "CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]",
    "ENTRYPOINT /var/www/start.sh"
  ]
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
source "podman" "example" {
    image = "ubuntu"
    commit = true
      changes = [
      "USER www-data",
      "WORKDIR /var/www",
      "ENV HOSTNAME www.example.com",
      "VOLUME /test1 /test2",
      "EXPOSE 80 443",
      "LABEL version=1.0",
      "ONBUILD RUN date",
      "CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]",
      "ENTRYPOINT /var/www/start.sh"
    ]
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Allowed metadata fields that can be changed are:

- CMD
  - String, supports both array (escaped) and string form
  - EX: `"CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]"` corresponds to Docker exec form
  - EX: `"CMD nginx -g daemon off;"` corresponds to Docker shell form, invokes a command shell first
- ENTRYPOINT
  - String, supports both array (escaped) and string form
  - EX: `"ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"/var/www/start.sh\"]"` corresponds to Docker exec form
  - EX: `"ENTRYPOINT /var/www/start.sh"` corresponds to Docker shell form, invokes a command shell first
- ENV
  - String, note there is no equal sign:
  - EX: `"ENV HOSTNAME www.example.com"` not
    `"ENV HOSTNAME=www.example.com"`
- EXPOSE
  - String, space separated ports
  - EX: `"EXPOSE 80 443"`
- LABEL
  - String, space separated key=value pairs
  - EX: `"LABEL version=1.0"`
- ONBUILD
  - String
  - EX: `"ONBUILD RUN date"`
- MAINTAINER
  - String, deprecated in Docker version 1.13.0
  - EX: `"MAINTAINER NAME"`
- USER
  - String
  - EX: `"USER USERNAME"`
- VOLUME
  - String
  - EX: `"VOLUME FROM TO"`
- WORKDIR
  - String
  - EX: `"WORKDIR PATH"`

<!-- Builder Configuration Fields -->

## Configuration Reference

### Required

- `commit` (bool) - If true, the container will be committed to an image rather 
  than exported.

- `discard` (bool) - Throw away the container when the build is complete. This
  is useful for the [artifice post-processor](/docs/post-processors/artifice).

- `export_path` (string) - The path where the final container will be exported 
  as a tar file.

- `image` (string) - The base image for the Docker container that will be 
  started. This image will be pulled from the Docker registry if it doesn't 
  already exist.

- `message` (string) - Set a message for the commit.


### Optional

- `author` (string) - Set the author (e-mail) of a commit.

- `changes` ([]string) - Dockerfile instructions to add to the commit. Example of instructions
  are CMD, ENTRYPOINT, ENV, and EXPOSE. Example: [ "USER ubuntu", "WORKDIR
  /app", "EXPOSE 8080" ]

- `container_dir` (string) - The directory inside container to mount temp directory from host server
  for work [file provisioner](/docs/provisioners/file). This defaults
  to c:/packer-files on windows and /packer-files on other systems.

- `device` ([]string) - An array of devices which will be accessible in container when it's run
  without `--privileged` flag.

- `cap_add` ([]string) - An array of additional [Linux
  capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
  to grant to the container.

- `cap_drop` ([]string) - An array of [Linux
  capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
  to drop from the container.

- `exec_user` (string) - Username (UID) to run remote commands with. You can also set the group
  name/ID if you want: (UID or UID:GID). You may need this if you get
  permission errors trying to run the shell or other provisioners.

- `privileged` (bool) - If true, run the podman container with the `--privileged` flag. This
  defaults to false if not set.

- `pull` (bool) - If true, the configured image will be pulled using `podman pull` prior
  to use. Otherwise, it is assumed the image already exists and can be
  used. This defaults to true if not set.

- `run_command` ([]string) - An array of arguments to pass to podman run in order to run the
  container. By default this is set to `["-d", "-i", "-t",
  "--entrypoint=/bin/sh", "--", "{{.Image}}"]` if you are using a linux
  container, and `["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=powershell", "--",
  "{{.Image}}"]` if you are running a windows container. `{{.Image}}` is a
  template variable that corresponds to the image template option. Passing
  the entrypoint option this way will make it the default entrypoint of
  the resulting image, so running podman run -it --rm  will start the
  podman image from the /bin/sh shell interpreter; you could run a script
  or another shell by running podman run -it --rm  -c /bin/bash. If your
  podman image embeds a binary intended to be run often, you should
  consider changing the default entrypoint to point to it.

- `tmpfs` ([]string) - An array of additional tmpfs volumes to mount into this container.

- `volumes` (map[string]string) - A mapping of additional volumes to mount into this container. The key of
  the object is the host path, the value is the container path.

- `fix_upload_owner` (bool) - If true, files uploaded to the container will be owned by the user the
  container is running as. If false, the owner will depend on the version
  of podman installed in the system. Defaults to true.

- `systemd` (string) - Run container in systemd mode. The default is 
  `"true"`. Please note that other accepted values are `"false"` and 
  `"always"`. This allows the container to be run with systemd integration. 
  Note that podman will automatically mound additional folders to make 
  systemd work.


## Dockerfiles

This builder allows you to build Docker images _without_ Dockerfiles.

With this builder, you can repeatedly create Docker images without the use of a
Dockerfile. You don't need to know the syntax or semantics of Dockerfiles.
Instead, you can just provide shell scripts, Chef recipes, Puppet manifests,
etc. to provision your Docker container just like you would a regular
virtualized or dedicated machine.

While Docker has many features, Packer views Docker simply as a container
runner. To that end, Packer is able to repeatedly build these containers using
portable provisioning scripts.

## Overriding the host directory

By default, Packer creates a temporary folder under your home directory, and
uses that to stage files for uploading into the container. If you would like to
change the path to this temporary folder, you can set the `PACKER_TMP_DIR`.
This can be useful, for example, if you have your home directory permissions
set up to disallow access from the docker daemon.
