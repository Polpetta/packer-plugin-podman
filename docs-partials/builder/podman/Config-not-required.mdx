<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/podman/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `author` (string) - Set the author (e-mail) of a commit.

- `changes` ([]string) - Podmanfile instructions to add to the commit. Example of instructions
  are CMD, ENTRYPOINT, ENV, and EXPOSE. Example: [ "USER ubuntu", "WORKDIR
  /app", "EXPOSE 8080" ]

- `container_dir` (string) - The directory inside container to mount temp directory from host server
  for work [file provisioner](/docs/provisioners/file). This defaults
  to c:/packer-files on windows and /packer-files on other systems.

- `device` ([]string) - An array of devices which will be accessible in container when it's run
  without `--privileged` flag.

- `cap_add` ([]string) - An array of additional [Linux
  capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
  to grant to the container.

- `cap_drop` ([]string) - An array of [Linux
  capabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
  to drop from the container.

- `exec_user` (string) - Username (UID) to run remote commands with. You can also set the group
  name/ID if you want: (UID or UID:GID). You may need this if you get
  permission errors trying to run the shell or other provisioners.

- `privileged` (bool) - If true, run the Podman container with the `--privileged` flag. This
  defaults to false if not set.

- `pull` (bool) - If true, the configured image will be pulled using `podman pull` prior
  to use. Otherwise, it is assumed the image already exists and can be
  used. This defaults to true if not set.

- `run_command` ([]string) - An array of arguments to pass to podman run in order to run the
  container. By default this is set to `["-d", "-i", "-t",
  "--entrypoint=/bin/sh", "--", "{{.Image}}"]` if you are using a linux
  container, and `["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=powershell", "--",
  "{{.Image}}"]` if you are running a windows container. `{{.Image}}` is a
  template variable that corresponds to the image template option. Passing
  the entrypoint option this way will make it the default entrypoint of
  the resulting image, so running podman run -it --rm  will start the
  podman image from the /bin/sh shell interpreter; you could run a script
  or another shell by running podman run -it --rm  -c /bin/bash. If your
  podman image embeds a binary intended to be run often, you should
  consider changing the default entrypoint to point to it.

- `tmpfs` ([]string) - An array of additional tmpfs volumes to mount into this container.

- `volumes` (map[string]string) - A mapping of additional volumes to mount into this container. The key of
  the object is the host path, the value is the container path.

- `fix_upload_owner` (bool) - If true, files uploaded to the container will be owned by the user the
  container is running as. If false, the owner will depend on the version
  of podman installed in the system. Defaults to true.

- `systemd` (string) - Enforce Podman in running in systemd mode. By default this value is set
  to `true`, but it can be `false` or `always`.
  Please refer to Podman documentation for additional details

- `login` (bool) - This is used to login to private registry to pull a base container.

- `login_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate to login.

- `login_server` (string) - The server address to login to.

- `login_username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to login.
